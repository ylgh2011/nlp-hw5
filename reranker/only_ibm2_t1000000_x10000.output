mazda3 i-stop : a sports spirit sustainable
mazda will prove that the sporting spirit is not angered with respect for the environment .
for this purpose , it comes to include on the mazda3 the ruling system and to start the engine , called i-stop , an arrangement that , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses .
this second generation of mazda3 illustrated by the note it has achieved in its entirety .
details , finishing of the vehicle , the habitabilité , behaviour , mechanics , the system i-stop ...
all these aspects are remarkable about the new mazda3 .
starting with the driving position , it transpires that the seats fronts have a ergonomie and fixated excellent .
the reach of steering wheel is also very pleasant .
by continuing with all formed by both the picture of control and equipment , we see how mazda japanese continued along the tendency to create an internal futuristic design , with many buttons and orders , along with vivid colors red and blue .
this style reminds us , partly , that of the honda civic .
therefore we can say that both the mazda3 and the civic , both japanese , contrast with the reticence of german products , and in particular with the volkswagen golf , which all want to overcome .
in compact with the japanese , this car shop presents an habitabilité more than sufficient for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort .
comes on top of this a great trunk to regular forms .
engine system arrest and automatic start , at least for now , is available only on the gasoline engine two litres and 150 horses and change manuel six speeds .
this engine is a true happiness . it shows by its delicacy , low noise , benefits and control of its consumption .
indeed , although the mazda3 most requested are diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with petrol engine speed , both for his great comfort for his consumption controlled .
regarding the level of equipment , the model chosen for the test is sport , in other words that constitutes the greatest number of elements of series .
series of equipment , an assistant of way - rvm - shift that removes one death , controls on speed traction and stability , the regulator , the mirror internal photosensible , a computer on board on a large screen size , the independent parking sensors , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and audio , as well as the wheels of the bluetooth alignment of 17 inches , are particularly noteworthy .
in addition , as if this equipment is not enough , this premium version had the pack , which for 1,500 euros more , include elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon audio bose and a system with charger records .
round-up
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one the best cars compactes of its category .
it can be illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used , by his behaviour and by its high standard equipment .
in addition , those who do not perform many kilometres per year can opt for the i-stop linked solely on gasoline engine version 2.0 of 150 horses .
the only drawback of this model is its high price , located between 21 770 euros for the finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested , the sports model .
in return for this substantial sum , the mazda3 every day we provide a large dose of satisfaction .

the promise for fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism that allows only to face its electronic mail , without giving the possibility even see kind of coins attached or browsing internet .
he profita of its five minutes of glory in the united states when the magazine désigna as one of the products of the year .
in truth , it is more difficult to see in the street , but the idea sounds interesting , especially for the young .
unlike smart phones , peek offers a very low prices and a monthly subscription , less than half of what , for example , the subscription data costs the iphone .
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter , another with a free service of data for life , for six times more expensive than the peek .
fonpeek , presented yesterday during the event the web , is the european version of the invention and his third incarnation .
it is just as little as his american grand-frère , but with a surprise .
the price of its monthly subscription , approximately 12 euros , includes roaming throughout europe .
those who travel with a smartphone already know what represents the abandonment to data when you cross a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a connection to fon - to be able to check his mail .
the idea of a roaming a fixed price is incredibly seductive and long should function .
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options journey , but for me , i would need to have a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the fine print .
repeated reminders to order from the european commission to offer affordable price of roaming across europe have had a barely perceptible effect .
outside his home country , we hesitate to use the data , and was not wrong .
that a small plane as fonpeek - it is always curious he is called fon then that it does not possess the wifi - supply this kind of tariffs , means that operators are beginning to think differently and study various proposals to increase their network of data .
kindle is another good example , he understands downloading books and other searches on the internet .
without subscription and without together .
it comes with a device connected and it pays during its purchase and not every month .
and that is what i hope to see a day for purchasing the fonpeek : an option with access to life as peek proposes in the united states .
rather that i want to to buy it .
i look my mail on my phones , thank you .
i hope simply because i believe that it is a formula fairer to the consumer .
that would be interesting to see a computer presenting the same system .
colour favourite of michelle
the yellow is , without doubt , the favourite colour of the united states ' first lady .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama 's presidency of the united states with a habit ' and a coat of this color , indeed , she chose the same for supporting it in the second moment , without doubt , the most important of his life : in oslo the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a model very similar in both occasions : besides colour yellow ressemblante , a shooting towards the green with reflections bright , both times , the holding consisted of three parts : the habit ' , jacket and , at the same , tissue and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first glance , it would seem that the first lady of the united states follows the aftermath of princess of asturias and has chosen to deliver the same kept .
but the fabric where are carved up two blocs makes them very different .
if the assumption of office it was a thick dentelle , however , she was in oslo a velvet printed .
the accessories also are different : green shoe heel means for the first golden opportunity , and a similar model , but this time .
hairdressing too has changed : the hair are now met even though it was abandoned the previous times .
75 % of professional working mothers had problems because of their maternity
discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years , especially for women younger generations who want to be mothers .
that reveals the study " fertility and women 's professional career in spain , " carried out by the csic in collaboration with the instituto de la mujer .
the survey , conducted over 9 737 women 15 to 75 , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of the babies .
the study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a partnership and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and the type of employment occupied .
those who do not have any activity outside the home , work part time , or have a stable work little , they are earlier in a partnership , have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children .
in contrast , women with a stable job , mostly in the public sector , postpone entry into life couple and the first pregnancy , and having fewer children .
women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in couple . this figure is 4.1 among those in the public sector . " these data show that women have a stable job requiring more time in their lives for that , which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children .
more broadly , the type of job exercised influence the maternity , but less common the starting date of life , " explains the chercheuse csic margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor which widens the gap of age marriage of women and their first child .
according to the survey , the more the level of training is high , the more they have marient and have their first child later .
the difference is also maintains among women from the same generation .
for example , in the group having between 35 and 49 years , those who have made elementary and higher studies have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and to 32,1 years on average .
' another disctinction appears among women according to their level of education .
while those who have done some basic studies marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of average level or higher reverse this programme and give priority to obtain a stable job as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " stipulates mrs delgado .
diane kruger also is worth much
the cosmetic paris comes to add a new name to her list jalousée of ambassadors : diane kruger .

cowardly an aggression
last week , my mother , who has about 70 years , will promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 rose alongside it and our dog , a sang-mélé , saved the spa and weighing no more than six kilos , and without saying a word , they assenèrent two birds of feet who grew the dog seriously injured .
our indignation is great because we do not see what it is free amusing to attack on a small animal without defence which , in addition , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the outrage of a lady who is promenait quietly and , when it came to fear for injuria these individuals physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' or , ultimately , anyone who is weaker than him .
the episode held at around 5 p.m. , a tuesday like any other , in an area normally calm .
the dog has gémi any day .
naturally , we filed complaints to the station even though we doubt that it furthers district of much and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that cowards murderers were spanish .
outrage has led us to denounce this fact .
we do not understand what is happening youth to find amusing to mistreat free an animal without defence which gives us the love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do not know where is the good education and the respect for animals and persons .
michelin and fesvial sets for the wearing of helmet
the tyre manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety , fesvial , has launched a campaign to promote the port of helmet , mainly among motorcyclists youngsters like said today the two bodies .
this initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the wearing of the helmet , since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries , or even death , in case of accident in two wheels .
michelin said that the campaign was in keeping with his commitment to road safety , which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products more and more safe " and confirmed that it helped to this objective by other educational actions and informative .
this new incentives on wearing the helmet campaign in two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be , " a first stage in which include posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages effect , in order to guarantee the widest spread .
finally , michelin has stressed that the road safety is a constant concern " for the company , because as a tyre manufacturer vehicles on two wheels , one of its main objectives is to develop products increasingly safe .
the sale of light commercial vehicles to go
after almost two years , the light commercial vehicles market beginning to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain represent an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , more importantly , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to the figures of the union patronal anfac and ganvam producers , the dealers .
it is to qualify the good news , since the reference for the comparison , the november 2008 , was particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared to the previous year .
as a result , despite the events of last month , the immatriculations accumulated in these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year .
since january , if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , pick-up , vans , fourgons light and light trucks in windows 95 853 have been sold .
high clouds that affect the more their request did not eliminated . in fact , although they are bought by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium enterprises , who pay in nearly 100 % of the cases thanks to an external funding .
thus , in addition restrictions involved by restricting credit , we should add other factors such as the rise in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation .
faced with this situation and difference of cars , aid for the purchase of the 2000e have little served .
apart from individuals , the independent and those who wish to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of co2 emissions , which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , can also them , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , among ganvam , they recalled once again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these cars , and also to industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a 2010 similar to that which ends , for which she found a fall in sales , in private cars and the suv of 19 % .
assistance the emergency brake is now required
as has occurred with the system anti-lock restrictions abs and as this will take place with the stability control esp , aid the emergency brake systems will become compulsory element on the european cars .
mandatory they are already on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest of a period of vehicles has been set up late february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , even though , by its course of action , it can also help prevent many back shocks .
the assistant to the emergency brake is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the shot in the foot given by the driver .
but they do not always keeps the pressure until the end of time .
according to a study by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch , one third drivers involved in an accident did not support the brakes before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force .
until to 1 100 accidents
intervention of aid , revancha , requires the most of the brake system , reducing the distance which needed to stop the car .
according to a study by the eu , if all cars were with this kind of elements , until 1 100 accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of known smart emergency braking systems : it is a sinister on four with injured would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that , thanks to a radar or camera , detect obstacles and prevents the driver in addition to act slightly on the brakes .
if the driver reacts , it help in increasing the pressure on the applied , if it is necessary .
if it does not react , and although the collision is inevitable , the device is the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage .
general motors expanded until january the plan for opel
while the workers of the opel plant at figueruelas - zaragoza - have been warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors - gm europe , that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of april - probably the 8 - according to javier ortega , the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the opel rescue plan .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , intends to that each of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant party .
and this may mean that the final document , which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be postponed until early 2010 .
among gm , by contrast , there is a guarantee that a decision on the sale to saab should be taken in the coming days .
it is therefore not surprising that the swedish government has tightened pressure on the american manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible .
gm admits be in contact with any possible new buyers .
one of them could be geely , which also aspires to acquire volvo , but the application of the manufacturer dutch sports cars skyper , supported by the russian converg group , is becoming more important .
in cases where there would be in agreement with any of them , gm could sell a part of saab to the chinese company baic .
the decision to close saab at the end of the year if she is not sold is maintained .
driving of porsche boxster spyder
to devise their last and valuable gem , porsche , engineers have departed from the boxster s and have succeeded in the amincir that nothing less than 80 kilograms , which leaves the balance only 1 275 kilos .
this led to happen in the first place , the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof bâché manuel , to reduce 21 kilograms , using doors in aluminum like those of the gt3 , other 15 kilograms less , to remove the climatiseur , 13 kilos , to reduce the 64 to 54 litres of petrol tank , 7 kilograms of sports bacquets earned to climb , 12 kilos , and light with tyres 19 inches , five kilos .
finally , they have stopped using audio system cdr-30 , earning six others kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes gates by handles tissues , saving the remaining kilo .
although the model also exists with the pdk box in two embrayage manual , the test was carried out on a pretty box of six speeds , mainly on secondary roads of network of california , especially in mountains , with however tortuous .
his behaviour can not be described as blameless .
reducing the weight does not prevent the car of drive on the ground with aplomb .
on the contrary , it has been that we did not tested a model as small and slight which , at the same time , guarantees as secure in the however , including at high speed .
it is a small athlete , able to échauffer its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary , until we require him to sprinter , to curb , to recover and to push for new his engine ...
it is out what we wanted . thanks to his leadership , as forthcoming as precise , the car will do what will show our hands on the steering wheel .
and she will do so with surgical precision .
its engine to desire
the sound of its constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horses - 10 more than the boxster - was particularly successful and can be strengthened with option " sport " or through a system that is changing the rugissement the engine , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , either to halt or hopping .
are firm suspensions , but not harsh or uncomfortable .
road roads that we have travelled with the boyxster spyder was quite blighted , but the car has well managed the nests of chicken .
electronic assistants were barely here on the whole journey , while on some however we have found the ice in the early morning and graviers later in the morning .
ultimately , a car ultralégère , one of the most divertissantes to lead , and which is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be for sale in february 2010 , at a price 70 831 euros .

-lrb- hu -rrb- thank you very much
after days rose since the spring , when asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets , the uncertainty arises again , which is not surprising because he is their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future by nature .
the cure employed by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly through the abundant liquidity rates close to zero , so that financial institutions to buy assets to mobilise .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and without undermining their political maverick liquidity are starting to put a bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with their contracts to a year of next week .
investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a vice versa of reducing risk premiums .
volatility scholarships and different business obligations increase again , although they remain distant paranormaux levels they have attained at the beginning of the year .
states were obliged socialising the risk private and public debt is threatened once again .
there is again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany were shelter chosen by investors , provocative greater differences between the euro zone countries and germany .
spain has been barely affected by this episode of instability , but then standard & poor threatened with a new revised downward qualifications of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , a bit of uncertainty is not wrong to silence the defenders of moral risk , tried again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had impeded the destructive effects resulting from the credit limit on the destruction of the jobs , although what we should do is declare a new day of action of pardons .
but the situation of dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the sheiks to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of greece .
a government which conceals a deficit , elections and a new government which finds the tub with roses .
prodi did in italy after berlusconi and socrates portugal after durão barroso and
it would be totally irrational ecofin saves hungary a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro country for not fulfilling its commitments .
what makes sense , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government transparency and give its citizens share the need for extraordinary measures for maintaining the stability of its public finances .
if , as expected , we have a round of normalization of transitional risk premiums , after some excesses in positions would be predictable .
in the case of spain , until our differences of public debt has risen to match the european companies , nousn' bonds not need to be concerned .
if our differences and that europeans were continued to increase , then there would be a risk spanish idiosyncrasique .
the standard & poor 's case is a story . when our forecast indicators force most studies services to anticipate their recovery models and revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , with the oecd and the european commission , which are met with a japanese model pourl spanish economy , it adds little hope for their warning .
again , this has all seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets spaniards , although for the moment " caution is mother safety " .
segments connected
president of iberdrola , ignacio sanchez galán , was the first to speak yesterday before the congress subcommittee members , which is discussed these days the spain 's energy strategy for the next two decades .

iberdola , however , consider that for the next decade , investments must not be devoted to increasing the production capacity , but the distribution networks and to international connections .
from 2020 , the exchange and it will increase the strength .
his gamble focuses on both gas and coal plants , with recovering carbon dioxide and mechanisms , especially on renewable energies .
in this field , it considers that 18 thousand megawatts more are needed , with other energies of support . "
galán sustainable economy , which believes that the draft law that the government has to approve along the lines of what calls for his company did not want to tackle the royal decree to encourage domestic consumption of coal , which contradicts the policies to combat global warming .
according to him , there is a clear challenge to long term in this respect , despite the " specific measures , " as the president has qualified for iberdrola .
however , galán believes that investment decisions , although they are on the long run , will start to be taken because they put some time before reaching their maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them .

their participation in the champions league reported 476,4 millions to real madrid and barça since its creation
the champions league became a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992 .
indeed , the real madrid and f.c. barcelona won 467,4 million , which puts them at third and fifth clubs who have earned the more money into this competition .
the manchester united tops the list .
the manchester united tops the list .
win the uefa champions league does not only the glory . he is also one of the main sources of income of large clubs .
indeed , the competition has distributed five 362,5 million euros to 105 - 12 spanish teams that have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament during the 1992 season , according to information from uefa .
the f.c. barcelona and real madrid were well served at this distribution .
the continent 's white was the third club to reach the more money for his involvement , and the only with a.c. milan , has won three times the laurels .
the catalan club current taking the title and last winner of the former european cup in 1992 is fifth on the list .
first are the manchester united and bayern munich , the two teams , in addition , have charged the more money for their involvement in the last champions league .
and it , although they have lost before the barça .
on the other hand , spain is only the third country , regarding the money reported by the champions league , although it has won more titles than any other , five , while italy has won four , england and germany two - three .
pay-as-you-go model
this seeming paradox is by the complicated procedure for distribution of applied by uefa money .
this year 's body chaired by michel platini plans to win 1 090 million thanks to the champions league .
of this sum , uefa will 413,1 million fixed payments : each 20 clubs who attended the classification matches , including the madrid atlético has received 2.1 million .

there is also a bonus in case of victory - 800,000 euros and equal - 400 000 for each team . those who come to huitièmes final receive three million each , eight teams arrive in final quarter of reçoivent3,3 million .
the past four teams will receive each 4 million .
and the champion wins 9 million with 5.2 received by the other final .
so at fixed payments , a club gain at least 7.1 million , and maximum 31,2 million .
of the barça has pocketed 2.5 million for winning the super european cup in august .
but there are varying payments , which are enshrined 337,8 million .
this money is distributed according the proportional value of each market television .
the spanish market is one of the biggest , and have four seats attitrées .
the champion of the previous year making 40 % of the money allocated 30 % in the second , 20 for the third and 10 percent in the fourth .
another section will be paid according to the number of matches played in edition of this year .

new tools for expertise cars
in these days of bad weather and accidents the car garages are not only winners .
every day , thousands of cars which have suffered a sinister are brought up in a garage , where an must assess the damage and the cost of repairs .
each sinister is different and calculate the cost of coins and time of workforce can be a long and complex .
calculating compensation to hand the cost ranges between 20,000 and 30,000 euros , including coins and the workforce can take two or three hours .
instead with the assistance of the latest computer tools , this would be a matter of minutes .
it is for this reason that almost double experts use such systems .
service providers and solutions for the evaluation of claims and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information from manufacturers , and then treat them and offer them to their customers as a useful tool .
in spain , audatex , of the american solera is the company leader ; 80 % estimates are made with its products .
other companies compete in the field of assessment tools and drawing up information about the sector are gtmotive and eurotax .
working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from easy .
according to audatex eduardo velázquez , commercial director , enterprise in spain with 63 manufacturers and importers , and each of them provide information into a different format .
moreover , the amount of data to address is constantly increasing , so that over the past five years , more than versions , and motorisations variants have been launched in the past 15 years .
when a new car fate on the market these companies are at work .
this is a very hard work because it takes cataloguing every thousand pieces of the vehicle and keep prices .
we also establishes a graphic image ' smart ' of each model on which one can click on the various parts of a car for tourism .
whether he is a model sold massively , work could be ready within a week if the process moving very quickly .
if it is a little car sold it can take three or four months . currently audatex has information about 99,2 % of cars sold in spain .
among the most exclusive models they have such information about the porsche , but not ferrari and lamborghini .
vehicle movement , the figure exceeds the 99 percent .
for the job of documentation and preparing the databases , audatex has eight centers spread throughout the world - spain , france , germany , the united states , brazil , mexico , china and japan , and each of them specialises in some brands .
the national headquarters is located to alcobendas , madrid .
here more than 100 technicians or general mechanical experts work simultaneously on three computer screens .
audatex invests annually 90 million for these databases .
each month , 2.5 million data is stored and customers are actualisations every two days .
drafting this huge flow of information allows these enterprises to give them different uses and to offer products varied .
the most frequent application for the repair and maintenance , but in different countries , there are also tools for managing pieces of smashing or to calculate the value vénale or residual of a car .
the only company with a guide who making inquiries about the value used car in spain is eurotax .
audatex suggests not in our country but the united states .
in view of the products offered by audatex , it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support that she can provide for professionals .
this company provides ten different tools , the flagship being audaplus , the solution standard evaluation of claims for experts .
there are cars , motorcycles and industrialists light and heavy vehicles .
besides the cost of repair parts it takes into account the time estimated by the manufacturer or fees of paint .
this tool buys according to its use for each estimate .
the highest cost is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little maximum ten times per month .
then every insurance company , which operates thousands of expertise negotiates with audatex price .
other products , as audavin , allow the full identification of a vehicle and equipment with which he emerged from the assembly line , only by the number of windows .
audaglass concentrates on car glasses and audasubastas is an open server at internet industry which provides enchérir on vehicles declared wrecks .
his office of statistics is very useful to identify trends , conducting tests géo-démographiques or knowing the current problems by mark or by model .
it is possible to study , for example , how many models of a brand determined went to the garage for a breakdown or how suffered serious claims for a given period .
gt motivates is the only spanish company dedicated development of this kind of tools .
it markets , among others , gt estimate , which is also aimed to experts and provides digital images , as well as access to parts , price and official time manufacturers .
gt motivates is a company of the einsa founded in 1971 , as a provider of services and solutions evaluation , maintenance outages or devoiture disasters .
leader gt evaluation is a product of historical reference in the market .
enterprise works with 24 thousand users in garages , 3 100 specialists and 53 insurance companies .
its business volume rose at a rate of 20 percent per annum over the last three years , and she has done a turnover of 10,8 million euros in 2008 .

auction on internet of cars accidentées
last october , the solera bought autoonline , internet platform for selling cars , motorcycles and special vehicles affected .
the operation has involved a cost 59,5 million euros for 85 percent of the company 's capital that could widen next year to 15 % .
the objective of the acquisition was to deliver more value added services to its customers , with the possibility to reach a huge market internationally .
estimates of this service and sale addresses only professionals such as the insurance companies , experts , rental companies , the garages , professional casses and vendors who must be registered before starting to carry out operations .

under spanish law , a car with the chassis number has been removed can not move , but some components which are not damaged can be used as spare parts .
vintage cars can be réenregistrées , although they have been withdrawn after complicated steps .
wrong estimate in four stages
with the tool auda-taller , the company audatex ensures that the user gets an estimate only four stages : identify the vehicle , seek the spare , create a coin estimate and generate .
the ease of use is an essential element of these systems , especially for convincing the older professionals who , to a greater or lesser extent , are resistant to the use of new technology management .
the database includes 1 034 passenger vehicles , including 666 109 tout-terrains , 137 bikes , 78 vans and 44 trucks .
naturally , for using a computer and an internet connection are necessary .
once the model to repair identified thanks to its chassis number , a graphic image model in question is can you really selects the coin necessary .
the user can include variables like the price of the workforce , supplements or reductions and then it can set the estimate for the return to the customer .
audataller is not a tool of estimate as audaplus but a litany of references .
the difference between these two systems is than that for garages does not include estimated time of workforce .
the cost of use this tool for the garage is 350 per year , which can be a credit .
currently the company audatex works for that these pictures are in three dimensions .
this is something that engineers take a very positive because it will , for example , select a door and turn to see the face internal .
