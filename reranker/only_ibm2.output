mazda3 i-stop : sporting spirit sustainable
mazda will prove the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment .
for this purpose , it has to incorporate the mazda3 the system of ruling and start the engine , called i-stop , a measure which , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses .
this second generation mazda3 be illustrated by the whole note that it did .
details , finishing the vehicle , the habitabilité , behaviour and mechanics , the system i-stop ...
all these aspects are remarkable about the new mazda3 .
starting with the driving position , it appears that those seats fronts have a ergonomie and fixated excellent .
the reach of steering wheel is also very pleasant .
by continuing with all formed by both the picture of control and equipment , we see how mazda japanese continued along the tendency to create an internal futuristic design , with many buttons and orders , along with vivid colors red and blue .
this style reminds us , partly , that of the honda civic .
therefore we can say that both the mazda3 and the civic , both japanese , contrast with the reticence of german products , and in particular with the volkswagen golf , which all want to overcome .
in compact with the japanese , this car shop has ample habitabilité for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort .
comes on top of it a great trunk to regular forms .
engine arrest and launch automatic system , at least for now , is available on the gasoline engine two litres and 150 horses and change manual of six speeds .
this engine is a true happiness . it shows by its delicacy , low noise , benefits and control of its consumption .
indeed , although the most requested mazda3 are diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with petrol engine , both for his great comfort to speed that controlled for consumption .
regarding the level of equipment , the model chosen for the test is sport , in other words that constitutes the greatest number of elements of series .
series of equipment , an assistant of way - rvm - shift that removes one death , controls on speed traction and stability , the regulator , the mirror internal photosensible , a computer on board on a large screen size , the independent parking sensors , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and audio , as well as the wheels of the bluetooth alignment of 17 inches , are particularly noteworthy .
in addition , as if this equipment is not enough , this premium version had the pack , which for 1,500 euros more , include elements of adaptive headlights bi-xénon audio bose and a system with charger records .
round-up
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop is one the best cars compactes of its category .
it can be illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used , by his behaviour and by its high standard equipment .
moreover , those who do not perform many kilometres per year will opt for the i-stop involved only the gasoline engine version 2.0 150 horses .
the only drawback of this model is its cost , which lies between 21 770 euros for finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested , the sports model .
in return for this large sum the mazda3 every day we provide a large dose of satisfaction .
' first of luxury
l.a. includes the red carpet of sensualité incarnated by penélope cruz , nicole kidman and fergie .
the stars more than ever we have blinded , vêtues of models as elegant as sexys for the exit of nine . - photos : gtresonline .
our ' ep ' , as sophisticated as accustomed , had opted for a " lady " bleak .
the promise of fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a mechanism that allows only to watch his email , without the opportunity to see even kind of coins attached or browsing internet .
it profita his five minutes to glory to the united states when the magazine désigna as one of the products of the year .
in truth , it is more difficult to see in the street , but the idea seems interesting , especially for the young .
unlike smart phones , peek offers a very low price and a monthly subscription , less than half of the cost , for instance , the subscription data iphone .
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter , another with a free service of data for life , for six times more expensive than the peek .
fonpeek , presented yesterday during the event the web , is the european version of the invention and his third incarnation .
it is so limited that the american grand-frère , but has come as a surprise .
the price of its monthly subscription , approximately 12 euros , includes roaming throughout europe .
those who travel with a smartphone already know what represents the abandonment to data when you cross a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a connection to fon - to be able to check his mail .
an roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and long it should work .
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options journey , but for me , i would need to have a thesis in physics for the understanding and good glasses to read the fine print .
repeated reminders to order from the european commission to provide affordable price of roaming across europe have had a barely perceptible effect .
outside his home country , we hesitate to use the data , and was not wrong .
that a small plane as fonpeek - it is always curious he is called fon then that it does not possess the wifi - supply this kind of tariffs , means that operators are beginning to think differently and study various proposals to increase their network of data .
kindle is another good example , he understands downloading books and other searches on the internet .
without subscription and without together .
it comes with a device connected and it pays during his purchase and not every month .
and that is what i hope one day seeing for purchasing the fonpeek : an option with access to life as peek proposed in the united states .
no that i want to to buy it .
i look my mail on my phones , thank you .
i hope simply because i believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer .
it would be interesting to see a computer with this same system .
preferred colour of michelle
the yellow is without doubt , favourite colour of the first lady of the united states .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama to the american presidency with a habit ' and a coat of this color , indeed , she chose the same for supporting it in the second moment , without doubt , the most important of his life in oslo : the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a very similar both times : besides colour ressemblante model , a yellow shooting towards the green with reflections bright , both times , the holding consisted of three parts : the habit ' , jacket and , at the same tissues and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first glance , it would seem that the first lady of the united states follows the aftermath of princess of asturias and has chosen to deliver the same kept .
but the fabric where are carved up two blocs makes them very different .
if the assumption of office it was a dentelle thick , but it was in oslo a velvet printed .
the accessories also are different : green shoe heel means for the first golden opportunity , and a similar model , but this time .
hairdressing too has changed : the hair are now met even though it was abandoned the previous times .
75 % of working mothers had problems professionals because of their babies
discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years , especially for women younger generations who want to be mothers .
that reveals the study " fertility and women 's professional career in spain , " carried out by the csic in collaboration with the instituto de la mujer .
the survey , conducted over 9 737 women 15 to 75 , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their professional career limited because of the babies .
the study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a partnership and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and the type of employment occupied .
those who do not have any activity outside the home , work part time , or have a stable work little , they are earlier in a partnership , have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children .
in contrast , women with a stable job , mostly in the public sector , postpone entry into life couple and the first pregnancy , and having fewer children .
women between 35 and 49 years with a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in couple . this figure is 4.1 among those in the public sector . " these data show that women have a stable job requiring more time in their lives for that , which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children .
more broadly , the type of job exercised influence the maternity , but less common the starting date of life , " explains the chercheuse csic margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor widening the gap of age of marriage women and their first child .
according to the survey , the more the level of training is high , the more they have marient and have their first child later .
the difference is also maintains among women from the same generation .
for example , in the group having between 35 and 49 years , those who have made elementary and higher studies have been mothers respectively for the first time to 25,1 and to 32,1 years on average .
' another disctinction appears among women according to their level of education .
while those who have done basic studies marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of higher average level or reverse this agenda and give priority to the achievement of a stable as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " stipulates mrs delgado .
diane kruger also is worth much
the cosmetic paris comes to add a new name to its list jalousée to ambassadors : diane kruger .
from next year , the german actress will embody the image of several products of the brand , entonnant the universal currency ' because i am worth well " .

a cowardly assault
last week , my mother , who has about 70 years , will promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people aged between 15 and 18 rose alongside it and our dog , a sang-mélé , saved the spa and weighing no more than six kilograms , and without saying a word , they assenèrent two birds of feet who grew the dog seriously injured .
our indignation is great because we do not see what it is free amusing to attack on a small animal without defence which , in addition , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the outrage of a lady who is promenait calmly and , when it came to fear for injuria these individuals physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' or , ultimately , anyone who is weaker than him .
the episode held at around 5 p.m. , a tuesday like any other , in an area normally quiet .
the dog has gémi any day .
naturally , we filed complaints to the station even though we doubt that it furthers district of much and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that cowards murderers were spanish .
outrage has led us to denounce this fact .
we do not understand what happens to young people to find amusing to mistreat defenceless free an animal who gives us love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do not know where is the good education and the respect for animals and persons .
michelin and fesvial sets for the wearing of helmet
the tyre manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety , fesvial , has launched a campaign to promote the port of helmet , mainly among motorcyclists youngsters like said today the two bodies .
this initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the wearing of the helmet , since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries , or even death , in case of accident in two wheels .
michelin said that the campaign was in keeping with his commitment to road safety , which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products more and more safe " and confirmed that it helped to this objective by other educational actions and informative .
this new incentives on wearing the helmet campaign in two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be , " a first stage in which include posters will be distributed in more than 500 garages effect , in order to guarantee the widest spread .

the sale of light commercial vehicles to go
after almost two years , the market of light commercial vehicles beginning to some light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain represent an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , more importantly , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive month of decline , according to estimates by the patronal manufacturers association anfac and ganvam , of the dealers .
it is to moderate the good news , since the reference for the comparison , the november 2008 , was particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared to the previous year .
as a result , despite the events of last month , the immatriculations accumulated during these 11 months are 40 per cent below those of the previous year .
since january , if we add all vehicles entering the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , vans , pick-up fourgons light and light trucks in windows 95 853 have been sold .
high clouds that affect their request did not eliminated . in fact , although they are bought by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium enterprises , who pay in nearly 100 % of the cases through an external financing .
as more restrictions involved by restricting credit , we should add other factors as the rise in the unemployment rate and the persistence of the bad economic situation .
faced with this situation and difference private cars , support for the purchase of 2000e were served .
apart from individuals , the independent and those who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a level of co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , can also them , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , among ganvam , they recalled once again the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these cars , and also to industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a 2010 similar to that which ends , for which she found a fall in sales , in private cars and the suv of 19 % .
assistance the emergency brake is now required
as has occurred with the system anti-lock restrictions abs and it will take place with the esp , stability control systems of compulsory help the emergency brake will form part of the european cars .
mandatory they are already on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , while the rest of a period of vehicles has been set up late february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , seeks to strengthen the protection of pedestrians , although action , by the way , it can also help prevent many shocks back .
the assistant to the emergency brake is increasing the pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the shot in the foot given by the driver .
but they do not always keeps the pressure until the end of time .
according to a study by the manufacturer of components for cars bosch , one third drivers involved in an accident did not support the brakes before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force .
up 1 100 accidents
intervention of aid , revancha , requires the most of the brake system , reducing the distance which needed to stop the car .
according to a study by the eu , if all cars were with this kind of elements , until 1 100 accidents where pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even greater with the popularisation of said smart emergency braking systems : it is a sinister on four with the injured would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that with a radar or a camera , detect obstacles and prevents the driver , in addition to act slightly on brakes .
if the driver reacts , it help in increasing the pressure on the applied , if it is necessary .
if it does not react , and although the collision is inevitable , the facility has the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize the damage .
general motors postponed until january plan for opel
when workers of the opel plant at figueruelas - zaragoza - have been warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors - gm - europe , that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of april , probably on 8 , according to javier ortega , the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the opel rescue plan .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , intends to that each of the plan has been approved in advance by the relevant party .
and this may mean that the final document , which will first be submitted to workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be postponed until early 2010 .
among gm , by contrast , there is a guarantee that a decision on the sale to saab should be taken in the coming days .
it is therefore not surprising that the swedish government has tightened pressure on the american manufacturer to take a decision as soon as possible .
gm admits be in contact with any possible new buyers .
one of them could be geely , which also aspires to acquire volvo , but the application of the manufacturer dutch sports cars skyper , supported by the russian converg group , is becoming more important .
in cases where there would be in agreement with any of them , gm could sell a part of saab to the chinese company baic .
the decision to close saab at the end of the year if she is not sold is maintained .
driving of porsche boxster spyder
to devise their last and valuable gem , porsche , engineers have departed from the boxster s and have succeeded in the amincir that nothing less than 80 kilograms , which leaves the balance only 1 275 kilos .

finally , they have stopped using audio system cdr-30 , earning six kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes gates by handles tissues , saving the remaining kilo .
although the model also exists with the pdk box in two embrayage manual , the test was carried out on a pretty box of six speeds , mainly on secondary roads of network of california , especially in mountains , with however tortuous .
his behaviour can not be described as blameless .
reducing the weight does not prevent the car of drive on the ground with aplomb .
on the contrary , it has been that we had not tested a model as small and light which , at the same time , guarantees as security in the however , including at high speed .
it is a small athlete , able to échauffer its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary , until we require him to sprinter , to curb , to recover and to push for new his engine ...
it is out what we wanted . thanks to his leadership , as forthcoming as precise , the car will do what will show our hands on the steering wheel .
and she will do so with surgical precision .
her engine will
the sound of its constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horses - 10 more than the boxster - was particularly successful and it can be strengthened with option " sport " or through a system that is changing the rugissement the engine , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , both ruling or hopping .
are firm suspensions , but not harsh or uncomfortable .
road surface that we travelled with the boyxster spyder was quite blighted , but the car has well managed the nests of chicken .
electronic assistants were barely here on the whole journey , while on some however we have found the ice in the early morning and graviers later in the morning .
ultimately , a car ultralégère , one of the most divertissantes to lead , and which is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be for sale in february 2010 , at a price 70 831 euros .

-lrb- hu -rrb- thank you very much
after days rose since the spring , when inflation was the dominant note assets on the markets , the uncertainty arises again , which is not surprising because he is their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future by nature .
the remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets was the direct purchase of assets to monetize the debt and indirectly by abundant liquidity rates close to zero , so that the purchase of assets to mobilize financial institutions .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and without undermining their political maverick liquidity are starting to put a bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with their contracts to a year of next week .
investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a vice versa of reducing risk premiums .
volatility scholarships and different business obligations increase again , although they remain distant paranormaux levels they have attained at the beginning of the year .
states were forced socialising risk private and public debt is threatened once again .
there is again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany were shelter chosen by investors , provocative greater differences between the euro zone countries and germany .
spain was barely affected by this episode of instability , but then standard & poor threatened with a new revised downward qualifications of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , some uncertainty is not a bad to silence the defenders of moral hazard , tried again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy derived had slowed the destructive effects of restricting credit on the destruction of the jobs , although what we should do is declare a new action day pardons .
but the situation of dubai resembles a fight between tribal sheiks to restore place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of greece .
a government concealing a deficit , elections and a new government that finds the tub with roses .
prodi did italy after berlusconi and socrates portugal durão barroso .
it is quite irrational ecofin saves hungary a breach of its external payments at the start of the year and allow a euro country for not fulfilling its commitments .
what makes sense , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government transparency and give its citizens share the need for extraordinary measures for maintaining the stability of its public finances .
if , as expected , we have a transitional round of normalization of risk premium , after some excesses in positions would be predictable .
in the case of spain , until our differences of public debt has risen to match the european companies , nousn' bonds not need to be concerned .
if our differences and that europeans were kept increasing , then we would be a risk idiosyncrasique spanish .
the standard & poor 's case is a story . when our forecast indicators force most studies services to anticipate their recovery models and revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , with the oecd and the european commission , which are met with a japanese model pourl spanish economy , it adds little hope for their warning .
again , this all sounds to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets spanish , although for now " caution is mother safety . "
connected sectors
president of iberdrola , ignacio sanchez galán , was the first to speak yesterday before the congress subcommittee members , which is discussed these days spain 's energy strategy for the next two decades .

iberdola , however , believes that for the next decade , investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity , but the distribution networks and to international connections .
from 2020 , the exchange and it will increase the strength .
his gamble focuses on both gas and coal plants , with recovering carbon dioxide and mechanisms , especially on renewable energies .
in this area , it considers that 18 thousand megawatts more are needed , with other energies of support . "
galán sustainable economy , which believes that the draft law that the government has to approve along the lines of what calls for his company did not want to tackle the royal decree to encourage domestic consumption of coal , which contradicts the policies to combat global warming .
according to him , there is a clear challenge to long term in this respect , despite the " specific measures , " as the president has qualified for iberdrola .
however , galán believes investment decisions , although they are in the long term , will start to be taken because they put some time to reach maturity and a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them .

the f.c. barcelona and real madrid were well served at this distribution .
the continent 's white was the third club to reach the more money for his involvement , and the only with a.c. milan , has won three times the laurels .
the catalan club current taking the title and last winner of the former european cup in 1992 is fifth on the list .

the past four teams will receive each 4 million .
and champion wins final 9 million from 5.2 received by the other .
so at fixed payments , a club wins at least 7.1 million , and maximum 31,2 million .
of the barça has pocketed 2.5 million for winning the super european cup in august .
but there are varying payments , which goes 337,8 million .
money distributed according to the proportional value each television market .
the spanish market is one of the largest , and have four seats attitrées .
the champion of last year making 40 % of the money allocated 30 % in the second , 20 for the third and 10 percent in the fourth .
